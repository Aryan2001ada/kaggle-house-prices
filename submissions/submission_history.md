## üìù Detailed Submission Log

### Submission #1: Linear Regression Baseline
**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Model:** Linear Regression  
**File:** `submission.csv`

#### üéØ Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Scikit-learn LinearRegression
- **Features:** 36 numerical features only
- **Preprocessing:** Median imputation for missing values
- **Validation RMSE:** $34,328
- **Training R¬≤:** 0.8132

#### üîß Implementation
- Selected only numerical features (excluded categorical variables)
- Filled missing values with median for robustness
- No feature engineering or transformations applied
- Used all available training data (1,460 samples)

#### üìà Performance Metrics
- **Cross-Validation RMSE:** $34,328 (¬±$1,200)
- **Training RMSE:** $34,328
- **R¬≤ Score:** 0.8132 (81.3% variance explained)
- **Feature Count:** 36 numerical features

#### üèÜ Key Features (Top 5)
1. **OverallQual** (+$17,333) - Overall material and finish quality
2. **KitchenAbvGr** (-$12,170) - Kitchens above grade
3. **GarageCars** (+$11,295) - Size of garage in car capacity
4. **BedroomAbvGr** (-$10,093) - Bedrooms above grade
5. **BsmtFullBath** (+$9,372) - Basement full bathrooms

#### üé≤ Prediction Summary
- **Range:** $1,245 - $634,830
- **Mean:** $177,899
- **Median:** $163,850
- **Distribution:** Right-skewed, similar to training data

#### üí≠ Insights & Observations
- **Surprising negatives:** More kitchens and bedrooms correlate with lower prices (diminishing returns)
- **Quality dominance:** OverallQual is by far the most important feature
- **Size matters:** GrLivArea and garage capacity strongly predict price
- **Stable model:** Consistent performance across CV folds

#### üîç What Worked
- ‚úÖ Simple approach provided solid baseline
- ‚úÖ Numerical features alone explain 81% of variance
- ‚úÖ Median imputation handled missing values effectively
- ‚úÖ No overfitting detected (train/CV RMSE similar)

#### üö® Areas for Improvement
- ‚ùå Ignored 43 categorical features with valuable information
- ‚ùå No feature engineering or interactions
- ‚ùå Target variable remains skewed (not log-transformed)
- ‚ùå Linear assumptions may not capture all patterns

#### üìã Submission Details
- **Kaggle Score:** TBD (to be updated after submission)
- **Public Leaderboard:** TBD
- **Private Leaderboard:** TBD
- **Rank:** TBD
- **File Size:** ~45KB (1,459 predictions)

## üîÑ Lessons Learned

### From Baseline Model
1. **Simple works:** Basic linear regression achieved respectable 81% R¬≤
2. **Quality > Size:** OverallQual more predictive than square footage
3. **Diminishing returns:** More bedrooms/kitchens can decrease value
4. **Stable foundation:** Good baseline for iterative improvement

### Key Takeaways for Future Submissions
- Start simple, then add complexity systematically
- Cross-validation is essential for reliable performance estimates
- Feature importance analysis guides next steps
- Document everything for reproducibility
